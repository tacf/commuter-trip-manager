# Commuter Trip Manager

_Commuter Trip  Manager_ is a python based cli that allows you to manage your carpooling easily. Allowing each carpooling participant to track is contributions to the cause.

## How it works

This  manager is based on the premises of fairness for each of the members.

Each member contributions is based on the number of other users that he has transported in is own vehicle. Given that, every member has it's own account and the balance of the account indicates whether the driver has a status of contribution to the carpooling, i.e.,

*Positive Balance* - the member has given more lifts than it has hitchhiked.

*Zero Balance* - the member has given the same amount of lifts that he took.

*Negative Balance* - the member has hitchhiked more  than the rides he gave. (.... shame on you :) )
